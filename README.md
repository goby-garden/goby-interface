# Goby interface

This repo will be used to develop Goby’s graphic user interface (built with Svelte) and the desktop application (which integrates Sveltekit in Electron).
 
The interface receives data from and sends commands to [goby-database](https://github.com/goby-garden/goby-database), which accesses and manipulates goby’s `.db` project files using SQLite.

Publishing the Goby interface on the web is pending; it’s technically possible because I’m building it with Sveltekit, but the library used by goby-database ([better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3)) is node-based, and I will have to adapt it to use something like [sqljs](https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js) so you can edit databases in the browser. But I may also do something like Jupyter notebook, where you can initiate the application from terminal and use it in a browser tab. 

Repo contents:

- **`root`**: 
    - this `readme` and `notes.md`, a file for taking notes as I work.
    - **`src`**: contains all the code for Electron and the interface
        - `background.js` is Electron’s main file for managing and configuring application windows. For development, it simply connects to the HMR localhost server created by Vite. For deployment, it loads the static html/css/js from the `_dist` folder 
        - `preload.js` is an Electron preload script. It exposes endpoints for the front-end interface to communicate with `background.js` and make modifications to the project file.
        - **`renderer`**: the root folder for Sveltekit (normally called src), with Sveltekit’s [basic project structure](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure)
    - config files for sveltekit vite (used by sveltekit under the hood), and other Sveltekit defaults beyond my comprehension
    - **`dist`**: static html/css/js/assets produced by generated by Sveltekit’s [adapter-static](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static)
